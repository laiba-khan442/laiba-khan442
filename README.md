### Software Tester & Engineer | VU Student | Part-Time Developer

Detail-oriented **Software Tester and Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Quality Assurance and Software Testing**.  
Currently a **student at Virtual University (VU)**, balancing academics with **part-time development and full-time testing work**, focused on building reliable, user-centric software.

I enjoy breaking things *before* users do — and fixing them with clarity.
